## Problem solved

Roofing contractors lose jobs when follow-ups are slow or non-compliant. RoofingFollowFlow runs:

**Intake trigger → AI draft → consent gate → human approval → send → audit log → escalate hot replies**

## Core workflow (MVP)

1. Lead / service request intake
2. AI Hub drafts channel-specific follow-up + classification
3. Consent checked (email/SMS/voice)
4. Owner/staff approve
5. Message marked sent with audit trail
6. Qualified inbound replies escalate to staff
